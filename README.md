# VGG16-CatandDog
Explore the effectiveness of the VGG model, which achieved significant results in the ImageNet image classification competition in 2014, and use VGG for cat and dog classification

# VGG Model Principle
[VGG16 Content Explanation](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_62919535/article/details/132189691?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501)

The main feature of VGG is the use of a series of convolutional kernels with the same size of 3x3 for multiple convolution operations. One advantage of this structure is that it can stack more convolutional layers, allowing the network to learn more complex features.
